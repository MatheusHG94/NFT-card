## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is one of my first Frontend Mentor challenges. I'm trying to learn more about flexbox and how to use its attributes to properly display the elements on different screens sizes. I also used some hover features to display some elements over an image, which I thought quite nice.

### Continued development

Since I'm just starting my learning of HTML, CSS and web development in general, I'm still focusing on learning every aspect of these technologies, especially the fundamentals.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This source is helping me a lot in understanding the aspects of each element and attribute of HTML5 and CSS3.
